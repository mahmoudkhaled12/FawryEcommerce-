This repository contains my solution to the **Fawry Rise Full Stack Development Internship Challenge**.

## âœ… Features Implemented

- Define products with name, price, quantity.
- Support for both expirable and non-expirable products.
- Support for shippable and non-shippable products, with weight handling.
- Cart functionality with quantity validation.
- Checkout process with:
  - Subtotal calculation
  - Shipping fee based on total weight
  - Total amount paid
  - Customer balance update
- Error handling for:
  - Empty cart
  - Expired products
  - Out-of-stock items
  - Insufficient balance
- Integration with a `ShippingService` to list items that require shipping.

cart.add(biscuits, 1);
cart.add(scratchCard, 1);
checkout(customer, cart);
